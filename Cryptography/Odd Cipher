Ok, so this is an odd cipher. If you observe how the first 4 characters relate to flag, you'll notice that the shifting increment increases by 1 every time. How odd.
Of course, what's odder is that sometimes the letters will shift back to the beginning of their corresponding upper or lowercase alphabet, or they'll shift to a number of underscore.
Just edit the program below [whether or not it cycles] and find the readable combination of the outputs. Voila.

def shift(n,s):
    if ord(n) > 96 and ord(n) - s < 97:
        return chr(ord(n)-s+26)
    elif ord(n) > 64 and ord(n) - s < 48:
        return chr(ord(n)-s+26)
    return chr(ord(n)-s)
flag = 'nukr{JAxhUWVEkdJp}'
message = ''
step = 8
for char in flag:
    message += shift(char,step)
    step += 1
print(message)

flag{W3irD_C1ph3r}
