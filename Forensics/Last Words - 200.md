<b> Problem: </b> <br>
A CTF developer was found dead in his apartment last week. We found him laying on the ground with his computer screen on. This text document was what was on his typed on his screen. Can you figure out some clues?
Given File: Last_Words.doc


<b> Solution: </b> <br>

You're looking at the doc file, see nothing suspicious... everything is normal. But what's this text?? <br>
"<i>jr;[ ,r@@@ nrgptr o hp. jrtr od yjr g;sh‚Äù g;sh}f4sf+yu[2mh|</i>"

You may have to do a lot of testing on decoding this, and there really isn't any encoding method on making this text... other than the dying CTF developer couldn't see and had his hands shifted one space on his keyboard, so it translates to: <br>
"<i>help me!!! before i go, here is the flag: flag{d3ad_typ1ng}</i>"

Flag: flag{d3ad_typ1ng}
