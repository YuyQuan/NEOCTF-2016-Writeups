<b> Problem: </b> <br>
I love this brain. Adam is the core coder of the game development group that uses this icon.

Hint: No Password :)

<b> Solution: </b> <br>

You receive the file... can't really find much about it. You may find the game development group Adam is a core coder in, but that won't get you anywhere at all. So you look at the problem title <i> Mozaiq </i>. Let's look that up. Oh! It seems mozaiq.org is a website to hide a message in a picture. You should find a mozaiq decrypter from the site and put the picture in. From the hint, there's no password so you know we are in the right place! Hit Decrypt and you get the flag!
