<b> Problem: </b> <br>
Man, I wish I knew how to do this...

Hint: Adam learned how to do that a few months ago


<b> Solution: </b> <br>

Okay, so this recon has a quite vague description but according to the gif you were given, you find Donald Trump breakdancing. According to the description, you want to learn how to do that. So you could search "The trump dance" or something similar and end up finding this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9NAD0D54OI <br>
The flag is simply in the description in the video <i>Flag{makethembuildtheirownwall}</i>

The hint about Adam learned how to do it a few months ago can be used by finding Adam's youtube channel. He subscribed to the owner of the video and even commented <b>"<i>No way, best teacher ever</i>"</b> on the video a few months ago.
