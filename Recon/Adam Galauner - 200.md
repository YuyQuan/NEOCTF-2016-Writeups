<b> Problem: </b>
Isn't Adam pretty famous? I mean he has 1,000+ subscribers and 1,000,000+ views on a single video ;)

<b> Solution: </b>
You look up Adam online, and you could easily find his youtube on his inactive twitter account, or by using the same username as his github account. Simple as that.
The harder part is where to find his flag within his youtube. It said he had 1,000,000 views on a single video could have meant the flag was on that video. Unfortunately it was not (i saw many people look on that video searching for the flag). Instead the flag is hidden in the channels he features on his youtube channel. Hmm... There is something fishy about this channel: <br>

Translate that binary from the channel's description and the flag is yours! :)
